Big Think (2014), ‘we’re faced with a crisis of attention: which ideas should we engage with, and why?’. Big Think promises to help us sift through this vast informational rainforest, offering ‘an evolving roadmap to the best thinking on the planet’, so we can appreciate and use the important concepts that can be ‘lenses for envisioning the future’. John Sexton, the charismatic and polarising ‘imperial President’ (Aviv, 2013) of New York University, has seen that future, and in a Big Think video (Sexton, 2008) he offers an appropriately audacious thought on what it all means. ‘Biodiversity is good’, he empha- sises, challenging the obsolete American melting-pot ideology that tried to turn America ‘into some great Velveeta cheese of humanity’. No, Sexton warns, this kind of assimilationist logic is wrong and dangerous. 
Sexton’s (2008) contribution to these discussions involves ‘glocalizing’ NYU’s eco- systemic heritage: ‘we take being in that local city and we extrapolate it out to the world’. Sexton’s noösphere is what he calls the Global Network University: students are admitted to NYU through one of three gate- ways – NYU New York, NYU Shanghai, or NYU Abu Dhabi – and then spend parts of their degree programme circulating amongst a world urban system of ‘idea capitals’ including Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Sydney, Tel Aviv and Washington, DC. 
Kwame Anthony Appiah (1997) calls ‘cosmopolitan patriots’–‘men and women whose interests, vision, and alle- giance are not bounded by place or sover- eignty and who are ‘‘citizens of the world’’ as well as of their particular cultures’ (Sexton, 2010). While the phrase carries a whiff of elitism, ‘cosmopolitan patriots’ embody an elitism of meritocratic achieve- ment that moves beyond the narrow nation- alist patriotism of the 19th and 20th centuries – with a fresh transnational out- look that signals the possibility of a benign, empathetic and responsible collective force for progressive change. The world’s best stu- dents will come to learn with – and trans- form – NYU’s world-class faculty in ‘kaleidoscopic interaction with deep connec- tivity’, as humanity learns how to produce future generations of ‘citizens of global soci- ety’. This is among the world’s most selec- tive classes: of the more than 9000 who applied for the inaugural class, NYU Abu Dhabi admitted only 188, representing 39 countries and 43 different languages.1 Sexton draws inspiration from cosmopo- litan patriots as today’s planetary pioneers.2 2518 Urban Studies 52(14)  They have the competitive drive and individ- ual ambition signified by Richard Florida’s (2003, 2006) ‘creative class’, but their diverse and hybrid educational trajectories give them a transnationally refined version of the political progressivism associated with the ‘new middle class’ remaking of city life (Ley, 1996), and they also understand what it means to think and act within collective assemblages of the human and non-human – creative human beings circulating in a sys- tem that he describes as ‘connected skeletally by highly sophisticated’ ‘social networking technology’. To see where the cosmopolitan patriots are going, Sexton borrows from a borrowed metaphor of Prime Minister Gordon Brown: To adapt an aphorism coined by President Kennedy, the new frontier is that there is no frontier: no frontier for the internet, for the mobile phone, for e-mails, for the cyber-world; no frontier for the capacity of individuals to influence, inform, or even infuriate each other. 
Ruth Glass (1964) first gave us a word to describe this process of urban transformation. In The New Urban Frontier, Neil Smith (1996) analysed how the genoci- dal disposessions of Frederick Jackson Turner’s understanding of the frontier in 18th- and 19th-century America – ‘the meet- ing point between savagery and civilization’ (Turner, 1893: 200) – became the powerful discourses and material realities of develo- pers ‘circling the wagons’ to retake Harlem and all the other territories lost in America’s 20th-century urban crisis. In ‘Gentrification as global urban strategy’, Smith (2002) diag- nosed how these frontier processes were being consolidated through transnational urban systems of entrepreneurial capitalist- state coalitions mobilising city spaces as vehicles for speculative real-estate accumula- tion. And in one of his last written works, ‘The evolution of gentrification’, Smith (2011) diagnosed the accelerating pace of dispossession as cosmopolitan capital oper- ated through transnational network architec- tures of revanchist uneven development on a planetary scale. 
Eric Clark (1987), who under- took a meticulous examination of centuries of land records in order to build an empiri- cal foundation for Smith’s (1979) theory of the rent gap in the dynamics of urban trans- formation; more recently, analysing the unprecedented challenge of ‘collective self- regulation’ of planetary humanity that will be required if we are to achieve sustainabil- ity, Clark has documented the distortions of evolutionary science that have privileged ‘gene-centered thought’ and an ‘excessive individualism’ that obscures Darwin’s per- spective on species participating collectively in their own development (Clark and Clark, 2012: 563). In this paper, my goal is to extend this line of inquiry, focusing more explicitly on the matter of evolution in Wyly 2519  frontier metaphors in urban theory, and in the driving ambitions of cosmopolitan patri- ots and their visionary mentors such as John Sexton. My central claim is that we are liv- ing through a planetary software update of 19th-century, Turneresque social Darwinism – creating a bizarre transnational urbanisa- tion of Chicago School positivist logics masked by the deceptive drop-down-menu multiculturalism of Silicon Valley’s auto- mated postpositivist standpoint epistemolo- gies. The noösphere is the new frontier of gentrification as the new urban colonialism (Atkinson and Bridge, 2005) of today’s pla- netary cognitive capitalism. We are chal- lenged to reconsider the explicit and implicit political ethics of the ‘recurrence of the pro- cess of evolution’ in the ‘process of expan- sion’ of this new frontier (Turner, 1893: 200). 
Melvin Webber (1964) has been thoroughly transnationalised, as the ‘massive communi- cation systems’ (p. 86) of urbanism are now enmeshed in planetary networks of finance, information and production sweatshops – all interconnected through billions of smart- phones that promise the wealth of accumu- lated human knowledge at the swipe of a thumb. The possibilities seem infinite. But Silicon Valley’s noösphere is creating dan- gerous new frontiers of Turner’s evolution- ary encounters between ‘savagery and civilization’. 
Ruth Glass (1964: xviii) first wrote the word ‘gentrification’. As industrialisation trans- formed political economy at the beginning of the 19th century and produced the world’s first urbanised nation at century’s end, evo- lutionary perspectives on urban life were quite explicit. In Cities in Evolution, Patrick Geddes (1915) portrayed the day’s emergent, 2520 Urban Studies 52(14)  large, polycentric city-regions – what he called ‘conurbations’ – as the logical evolu- tion of previous kinds of cities, in a new industrial revolution. For Geddes, the old ‘paleotechnic’ industrial age dominated by obsessions with individual wealth and class division was evolving, through urbanisation, to a ‘neo-technic order’ of collective, civic wealth, ‘its skill directed by life towards life, and for life .’. Humanity would set its mind ‘towards house-building and town-planning, even towards city design; and all these upon a scale to rival – nay, surpass – the past glories of history’ (Geddes, 1915: 71). 
But if Park’s (1921) theorisation of the ‘collective mind’ and the ‘social conscious- ness’ was influenced by Spencer’s linear lais- sez-faire evolution – Spencer was, after all, a major influence on Albion W Small, the sociologist who hired Park at Chicago – there were other, more progressive influ- ences at work. Long before he came to Chicago Sociology, Park took a low-paid research assistant position after completing his doctorate in order to work at Harvard with the pragmatist philosopher William James. Earlier still, as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan between 1883 and 1887, Park had been deeply shaped by the teaching of a newly arrived PhD from Johns Hopkins – John Dewey. Of the ten courses Park took in the philosophy depart- ment, six were with Dewey. 
Harvey (1978: 68) once likened a debate request to ‘an invitation to the sheep to come sit down and parley with the wolves’. 
Nicholas Entrikin (1980: 47) writes in a land- mark history of human ecology, ‘in which knowledge evolved and expanded in order to meet the needs created by new problems’ faced by humanity. ‘Cognitive Darwinism’ might strike you as a bizarre, slightly trou- bling phrase: Darwinian evolution requires death to achieve progress, and ‘cognitive’ means that you are now thinking about what it means for that progress to involve your death. I certainly did a double-take, and thought of my own mortality, when I first saw the phrase in Entrikin’s brilliant histor- iography of a figure so central to Chicago School urban theory. The phrase has been forgotten, with only a few exceptions (e.g. 
Friedman’s (1953: 22) portrayal of the maximisation-of-returns hypothesis of firm survival in terms of ‘natural selection’ and Thorstein Veblen’s proposal for a recon- struction of economics as a ‘post-Darwinian’ science were downplayed in favour of the technocratic, neutral discourses that were coming to define American logical positi- vism (Hodgson, 2003a; Mirowski, 2005).5 The institutional and evolutionary econo- mist Geoffrey Hodgson (2003a: 93) notes that as late as the establishment of the Association for Evolutionary Economics in 1966, the label ‘evolutionary’ was adopted ‘only by ridding it of any of its former and Veblenian connections with Darwinism and by interpreting it in the broad and banal sense of ‘‘change’’’. And yet Darwinism had always been a ‘derivative of political econ- omy’ (Hofstadter, 1944: 38), what Donald MacKenzie (1976: 503) calls ‘the biological variant of political economy’. Darwin struggled for more than a year after his Wyly 2523  expeditions on the Beagle trying to make sense of his samples and empirical observa- tions, but it was only after he read a book on the political economy of population that he ‘at last got a theory by which to work’.6 The theory that Darwin finally got – Malthus’s (1798) Essay on the Principle of Population – had become one of the defini- tive manifestos of the 19th century. Darwin was reading the sixth edition, published in 1826 (Secord, 2008: xix), and it helped break his writer’s block as he worked out the details of his theory – until the discovery that the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was pursuing the same line of inquiry led to a simultaneous announcement at the 1858 meeting of the Linnaean Society in London. 
Hofstadter (1944: 144) observes, ‘the econo- mists might have had some justification for proclaiming that biology had merely univer- salized a truth that had been in their posses- sion for a long time’. The core of economics had always privileged laissez-faire competi- tion as a ‘doctrine of social selection’ (Hofstadter, 1944: 144), and Keynes (1926: 113) went so far as to declare that ‘the prin- ciple of the Survival of the Fittest could be regarded as one vast generalization of the Ricardian economics’. 
Hodgson (2009: xix) labels ‘The Dark Age of Darwinism in Economics’, the field’s foundational implicit social Darwinism conditioned the development of conventional urban theory, as neoclassical economic methodology was enmeshed with Chicago sociology frameworks for analysing neighbourhoods, cities and metropolitan regions. Classical economics and social Darwinism were both founded on an axio- matic trinity: (1) ‘the fundamentally self- interested animal’ maximising utility (survival), (2) the normality and universality of competition, and (3) the survival of the organism/producer/worker most efficiently adapted to its environment. Yet while ‘both classical economics and natural selection were doctrines of natural law’ (Hofstadter, 1944: 145), the 20th-century consolidation of econometrics created an entirely new infra- structure in which social Darwinist processes could be embedded in the technocratically scientific and presumptively neutral, objec- tive mechanisms of simultaneous equations, general and partial equilibrium solutions, and marginal productivity estimates as applied to the exploding observational vistas of economic data. The methodological gen- ealogy goes all the way down, to a literally embodied Darwinian lineage: we would not have the correlation coefficient if Darwin’s cousin, the eugenicist Francis Galton and author of Hereditary Genius (1869) had not been so obsessed with the ‘Gaussian Law of Error’ describing the variations around the averages of physical measures of human bodies (biometrics) and the ‘mental peculia- rities of different races’ (p. v); those varia- tions around the mean ‘could be made the source of intellectual progress: specifically for Galton’s purposes geniuses could be made’ (Barnes, 1998: 213). And in turn we would not have chi-square or regression if Karl Pearson had not been so anxious to ‘provide his particular form of Darwinism with a proper scientific basis’ (Norton, 1978: 6) and if he had not been inspired in 1890 to focus on statistics after meeting a zoology professor, Walter Weldon, who was infusing Galton’s ideas into evolutionary biology to create a ‘mathematical theory of evolution’ (Norton, 1978: 6). When Galton died, his financial remains allowed Pearson to become the first Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College, London, and to merge the two laboratories he directed – the Biometric Laboratory and the Galton Laboratory for National Eugenics – 2524 Urban Studies 52(14)  into the Department of Applied Statistics. 
Hoyt’s (1933: 314–316) famous ranking of the effect of different racial groups on neigh- bourhood rents in Chicago, from ‘English, Scotch and Scandinavians’ at the top to ‘Negroes and Mexicans’ at the bottom – emerged from interwar America’s putrid stew of market democracy and populist Spencerian eugenic racist thought. But all could safely be hidden in the multivariate masquerade of hedonic pricing models and the economic discourse of ‘property values’ as a floating signifier for the dangers of dif- ference.8 And the entire theoretical appara- tus was hard-wired as the default setting in the mainframes of urban public policy through the deceptively obscure accounting jargon of ‘highest and best use’, distracting attention from the political contradictions of property rights in capitalist urban planning (Krueckeberg, 1995). 
Harvey (1973: 135) sardonically observed, ‘All this actually means is that the rich group can always enforce its preferences over a poor group because it has more resources’ to exploit all the dimensions of competitive bid-rents. Similarly, Neil Smith’s first analysis of the transformation of Philadelphia’s Society Hill was aimed squarely at Urbanism, Incorporated: ‘The Chicago School’s latter-day followers have bequeathed to urban geography an empiri- cist and ecological quagmire in which sub- stantive theory nearly drowned’, Smith (1977: 7) wrote in the opening pages of his undergraduate honours thesis. This was the first salvo of a lifetime project of politics and research devoted to challenging the friendly, market-tested violence of the ‘con- sumer sovereignty’ logics that built the foun- dations of aggressive, state-driven neoliberal urbanism and populist middle-class support for revanchist wars on the poor and home- less. Nevertheless, despite the incisive rigour and political integrity of a generation of crit- ical perspectives on gentrification, an impor- tant genealogical insight has been neglected: the entanglement of gentrification with the suppressed memories of social Darwinism. 
Tom Slater (2015) has carefully theorised as ‘planetary rent gaps’ – are now the subject once again of evolutionary social physics models and frontier metaphors that would be all too familiar to Robert Park and Frederick Jackson Turner. The prolific science writer Philip Ball – an editor at Nature and contributor to the Financial Times who has chronicled the new field of ‘econophysics’ (Ball, 2006) – writes a story in the Guardian making the case that ‘Gentrification is a natural evolution’, based on a paper published in the journal Physics and Society. Those authors, Ball (2014) tells us, ‘are studying city evolution much as biol- ogists study natural evolution – almost as if the city itself were a natural organism’ – what Jane Jacobs called ‘the spontaneous self-organization of urban environments’. 
Ley’s (2010: 82) analysis of Vancouver’s position at the nexus of ‘a dispersed social and spatial field’ of ‘trans-pacific life-lines’ for competitive, entrepreneurial middle-class and elite fami- lies that incorporate ‘the capital-generating station of East Asia with the family- nurturing station of Canada into a single life-world’. Such transnational fields are now apparent across a growing number of cities, and fortunes are being made by those entrepreneurial pioneers of the noösphere who move quickest to adapt and exploit the new ‘science of collective behavior’ (Park, 1921) on the frontiers of transnational spa- tial fixes of informational capital. The pro- cesses Harvey (1989: chapter 8) diagnosed a generation ago as the ‘urbanization of con- sciousness’ are now operating through a glo- bal noösphere in an interconnected, evolutionary and variegated planetary urbanisation. 
America – what Jim Blaut (1993) famously called the ‘colonizer’s model of the world’ (see also Baptista, 2013; Harris, 2008; Lees et al., 2015a, 2015b; McCann et al., 2013; Ren, 2015). 
First, Thomas Maloutas (2011) offers an eloquent and strident challenge to the contemporary geographical and theoreti- cal expansion of gentrification research. 
Butler’s (2007: 163) response to Atkinson and Bridge’s (2005) diagnosis of a ‘new urban colonialism’: ‘the issue of ‘‘neocoloni- alism’’ is as much with the use and definition of the term as with its consequences’. 
Second, Loretta Lees (2012: 156) has recently challenged us to move ‘away from an ‘‘imitative urbanism’’ (from the idea that gentrification in the Global North has tra- velled to and been copied in the Global South) towards a ‘‘cosmopolitan urbanism’’ (where gentrification in the Global South has a more expanded imagination)’. Lees (2012: 158) gives us a clear warning: ‘We should not read gentrification in the Global South as simply the recreation of the periph- ery (the urban South) in the image of the supposed centre (London or New York)’. 
David Ley and Sin Yih Teo (2013) explore the intricate ambiguities between epistemol- ogy and ontology. Drawing on Aihwa Ong’s (1999) concept of ‘alternative Asian modernities’, Ley and Teo document a chorus of voices from the Asia-Pacific that challenge the dominant Anglo-American narratives of neoliberalisation – emphasising instead the distinctive built forms and politi- cal processes that culminate in the synthesis of market and state power in the constitu- tion of a ‘joint urban project’ (p. 14). Urban renewal is fused with national developmen- tal imperatives. Crucially, this alternative Asian modernity holds out the promise, Ley and Teo (2013: 1) write, ‘most surprising from a Western perspective’, of ‘a poten- tially progressive dimension for some impacted residents’ through systems of negotiated compensation and broad improvements in housing conditions. ‘[T]he cultural hegemony of property in Hong Kong and other parts of East Asia makes redevelopment of some low-income districts a more ambivalent process’, Ley and Teo conclude, ‘for locked within the displace- ment of redevelopment is the hope of a negotiated settlement with the state leading to improved housing’. 
Maloutas (2011: 43) reminds us, that only a tiny fraction of the world’s urbanites live in ‘the core cities that set the ways of seeing and understanding socio-spatial change that often become the deforming lenses through which we examine what happens in the rest’. 
Eric Clark (2015: 453) on a research visit to Taipei, in a confident asser- tion of the kind repeated at every opportu- nity, in every language, by developers, state officials and professionals in every city that is being remade, rebuilt, regenerated, renewed or revitalised. Alternative urban modernities that defy the contextual specifi- cities of Anglo-American gentrification while showcasing how ‘diverse actors and institutions invent and aspire to new ways of being global’ (Ong, 2011: 23) nevertheless involve the displacement of nearly a tenth of Shanghai’s population in a single decade (Iossifova, 2009), 720,000 for the Seoul Olympics (Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE), 2007), 3.45 million across the Asia-Pacific between 2003 and 2006 (COHRE, 2006), and at least 1.5 mil- lion for the Beijing Olympics (Shin, 2012). 
Lees et al. (2015b: 6) review the ‘significant debate in the 1990s about the contextual nature of gentrification’, and cite a wide range of contextual and/or compara- tive gentrification studies beyond the ‘usual suspects’. Today, however, as the ‘advanced capitalism’ once synonymous with the Global North shifts to the urban growth frontiers of the Global South, the ‘cosmopo- litan decolonisation’ of gentrification theory abandons the analytical and political poten- tial of all of this work. Lees et al. (2015b: 7) highlight the stakes when introducing their new edited collection of genuinely cosmopo- litan and pluralist analyses of ‘global gentrifications’: Without a gentrification theory that serves as an ‘umbrella’. the debate we are holding now in this book would probably not exist, neither would most of the gentrification debates held Wyly 2531  hitherto by scholars in different contexts, and nor would urban activists around the world be able to identify the different types of redevelopment-led displacement that are in many ways part of the same repertoire of class restructuring in global capitalism. 
Fernandes’ (2006) analysis of India’s new middle class). Ley and Teo (2013), however, document a recent ‘ontological awakening’ amidst worsening inequality in Hong Kong, while there are other indications of instabil- ity in the 21st century’s dialectical response to the Chicago School – the ‘Chinese excep- tionalism’ urban paradigm (Ren, 2015; cf. The Editors, Urban Geography, 2015). 
Creative Age’, Florida (2003: 17) empha- sises, ‘the mind itself becomes the mode of production, so to speak’, and the shift from an economy based on material inputs to one driven by intellectual resources elevates the importance of meritocracies – measurable and quickly adaptive meritocracies – in workplace divisions of labour and in the col- leges and universities that function as ‘talent machines’ in the ‘new global competition for talent’ (Florida, 2006). Together, all of the interdependent processes by which the ‘basic cognitive-cultural system of production’ is ‘transforming the economic foundations of many large metropolitan areas all over the world’ (Scott, 2011b: 289) are dissolving the relevance of the sharp categorical distinc- tions and polarising binaries of the gentrifi- cation debates: demand-side and supply-side causal explanations (Hamnett, 1991; Ley, Wyly 2533  1987; Smith, 1987), the role of ethnoracial and cultural lifeworlds as opposed to the cal- culative rationalities of profit and loss (Knopp, 1997; Rose, 1984; Taylor, 2003), and the fine-grained morphological differ- ences among residential, retail, and indus- trial redevelopment, or ‘classical’ versus ‘new-build’ reinvestment (Davidson and Lees, 2010; Lambert and Boddy, 2002). 
Istvan (2014) explains; ‘It’s not a huge jump to imagine governments seeing opportunity in using this. Many children born into pov- erty end up costing governments billions. . 
James Atlas (2011) read a brochure announcing the year’s win- ners of a prestigious study-abroad fellow- ship, and was astonished at the level of achievement: ‘Let’s call this species Super Person’, he suggests, and asks, ‘Do we have some anomalous cohort here? Achievement freaks on a scale we haven’t seen before? Perhaps there’s an evolutionary cause .’. 
Marc Andreesen (2011) has described as ‘software eating the world’, as code replaces conscious, embodied human labour. ‘Technology changes, and it changes more quickly than human beings change’, Nick Carr (2014: 40) warns. ‘Where comput- ers spring forward at the pace of Moore’s law, our own innate abilities creep ahead with the tortoise-like tread of Darwin’s law’. 
Carr’s (2014) review of the history makes it clear that those words could have been spo- ken by the pioneers of cybernetics (such as the child prodigy who entered Tufts University at age 11 and earned a PhD from Harvard at age 18, Norbert Wiener); but read those words again, and consider how each of these figures might respond: Herbert Spencer, John D Rockefeller, Patrick Geddes, John Dewey, Robert Park, Frederick Jackson Turner, Charles Galton, Ed Glaeser, John Sexton, Richard Florida and Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil’s ‘brain exten- ders’ and ‘nanobots’ connecting individual brains to the cloud promise to resolve the speed differential between Moore’s law and Darwin’s law – like the ‘genetic surgeon’ described by Sir Charles Galton Darwin back in 1955 – creating a new cognitive Darwinism that adapts to the stepped-up pace of competition in today’s survival-of- the-fittest worlds of social Darwinism. This is the future. For only US$12,000 (US$1,000 down) you can take the week-long Executive Program at Singularity University to learn how to adapt, compete and survive in an urbanising world where Silicon Valley’s update of Geddes’ ‘neotechnic order’ has intensified the urbanisation of social- Darwinist competitive evolution: the new planetary urban frontier. 
Appiah (1997: 617) begins his essay thus: ‘My father was a Ghanaian patriot. He once published a column in the Pioneer, our local newspaper in Kumasi, under the headline, ‘‘Is Ghana Worth Dying For?’’ and I know that his heart’s answer was yes .’. But when his father died, Appiah and his sisters found an unfinished note of ‘last words and wisdom’ for his children, including this advice: ‘Remember that you are citizens of the world’ (Appiah, 1997: 618). 
Darwinism’, Rescher (1977: 126) emphasises. Rescher’s (1977) ‘evolutionary epistemology’ places cognitive Darwinism at the centre of pragmatism much as Harvey (2011) places ‘mental conceptions of the world’ at the core of his contemporary understanding of a ‘coevolutionary’ histori- cal materialism. Rescher (1977: 307) makes the case that ‘European Marxists’ and ‘American pragmatists’ share the fundamen- tal ‘tendency of thought – the idea of the controlling role of the demands of practical life as the ultimate arbiter of cognitive ade- quacy’. Rescher’s (2005: x) subsequent inquiry has focused on a critical realist prag- matism devoted to ‘how we can manage our cognitive affairs sensibly in situations of imperfect information’. 
Friedman (1953: 22) includes scare quotes in his brief engagement with evolu- tionary theory: ‘The process of ‘‘natural selection’’ thus helps to validate the hypoth- esis – or, rather, given natural selection, acceptance of the hypothesis can be based largely on the judgment that it summarizes appropriately the conditions for survival’. 
Friedman (1953) manages to cite Veblen as well as Armen Alchian’s (1950) famous and explicitly Darwinian analysis of uncertainty without ever once mentioning ‘Darwin’ or ‘evolution’ in the text or the index. 
In a later chapter, Hoyt (1933: 355–356) describes the inner-city ‘blight’ that shaped US urban renewal policy and that Neil Smith (1979) would later theorise as the rent gap: ‘a low level of rents and a high percent- age of loss in collecting that small amount, a heavy rate of physical deterioration of prop- erty caused by waste, neglect, and acts of Wyly 2541  vandalism, reduce land values in these sec- tions occupied by ‘‘hobos,’’ seasonal work- ers, and criminals of Native American stock and by the lowest classes of Mexicans, negroes, and South Italians to a very low point. There is now a valley in the land- value curve between the Loop and the other residential areas .’. 
Michael Stegman (1969) responded to the runaway popularity of transportation models of urban structure inspired by the Alonso– Muth approach by emphasising the impor- tance of housing and neighbourhood aspects of consumer choice: ‘It is conceivable that while location rents are high near the core because of the concentration of nonresiden- tial activities and the relatively large number of particular consumers who find it either necessary or desirable to live near their places of work, these rents would be even steeper if the available housing were of higher quality and the environment more amenable. 
Young, 2015). See also Ley (2010: 56–64). 11. Yan’s real-estate analyses have been covered extensively in the local press for several years, and were then featured in a short piece in the New Yorker (Surowiecki, 2014) – a degree of attention from above on the urban hierarchy that was in turn noted by a local writer frustrated with life in the ghost- town blocks of investor-owned properties in one of Vancouver’s epicentres of transna- tional super-gentrification (Saddy, 2015). 
Burnett (2014); on the ‘ideologi- cal lineage’ from eugenics to contemporary psychopathology at the nexus of gentrifica- tion, homelessness and severe mental illness, see Durgan (2013); on the cultural politics of neighbourhood representation and the cor- rosive effects of gentrification on the mean- ings of local cultural practices, see Alfasi and Ganan (2015) on Jerusalem, Parekh (2015) on New Orleans, Chang (2015) on ‘aesthetic regulation’ in Singapore, and Scott (2011b) on ‘aestheticized land-use intensification’ in a variety of cities of the cognitive-capitalist ‘third wave’. 
Mazur and Perlez (2014) provide an account of Lu Wei’s ‘well-publicized dinners at fancy Beijing restaurants’ with China’s ‘Big V’s, referring to the ‘verified account’ social media icons with ‘millions of online fol- lowers’ who ‘had already shown how they could turn sensitive subjects – like forced relocations and environmental problems – into national debates that upset the Communist Party’. Robert Moses worked the media when he was taking a ‘meataxe’ to the Bronx, but his tools and informa- tional skills appear quaint and primitive when compared with Snowden’s NSA and Lu Wei’s Ministry of Cyberspace Administration. 
Gary Becker’s (1976) suggestion of a ‘genetic determination of . human beha- vior modelled along neoclassical lines’, Arthur Robson’s (2002) attempt to ‘show how Darwinian evolution would lead to utility-maximizing behavior consistent with the standard axioms of rationality’, and Kenneth Binmore’s (2005) use of game the- ory to build an ‘evolutionary theory of mor- ality and natural justice, while retaining utility-maximizing agents’ (all quotes from Hodgson, 2009: xxiii, xxv, xxv). The ‘explo- sion of research in economics inspired by evolutionary thinking’ (Dopfer, 2005: 3) has been so intoxicating for the possibility of hacking the source code of homo sapiens oeconomicus (HSO) as ‘the basic unit of an evolutionary’ paradigm that economists have become uncharacteristically reflexive on the secrets of their success: ‘What are the factors that may conceivably account for the present dynamism of evolutionary econom- ics? We get a first hint when we consider Wyly 2543  that, in their field of study, orthodox econo- mists encounter decreasing marginal returns with respect to new theoretical findings per additional unit of research effort or research time. Linking this with the conjecture that creative minds are attracted by new oppor- tunities for developing their theory enables us to obtain a hypothesis that accounts for the phenomenon that outstanding neoclassi- cal economists are increasingly turning to research areas that can be linked to evolu- tionary ideas’ (Dopfer, 2005: 3). 
Vivien Chang (2014) provides a vivid account of the overcrowded bus route (along with a Jacob Riis update) for readers of the national news magazine Maclean’s: ‘The buses to UBC are frequently operating over capacity, especially during peak hours, leaving students on the street corners as they pass by. Getting off the bus wet, tardy and irritable, I have often been struck by the irony of coming face to face with a luxury car and its gawking driver, and thinking, ‘‘So this is how the other half lives’’.’ References Aiello D (2014) Vancouver’s downtown Eastside: An ethnography of restaurateurs and neighbor- hood change.
